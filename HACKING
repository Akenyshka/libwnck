Substantive patches can be approved by any two of the current
maintainers (see the MAINTAINERS files), obvious patches by any one of
them.

libwnck sits halfway between the panel (as an applet) and the window
manager.  libwnck can be used by other applications and thus isn't
technically limited to usage as an applet, but it is not stable and
thus other usage isn't recommnded unless you want to update your app
often.  If you'd like to work on libwnck, some useful places to look
for more information are:
  gnome-applets/HACKING
    The HACKING file in gnome-applets contains links, tips, and
    information on writing panel applets, debugging them, and various
    best practices with them

  metacity/HACKING
    The HACKING file in metacity contains information on the ICCCM and
    EWMH which cover relevant X and freedesktop.org standards for
    communication between the window manager, specialized programs
    like the windowlist and workspace switcher applets, and clients.

    devilspie is for crack.  Not libwnck.

  gnome-panel/applets/wncklet/
    The actual panel applets based on libwnck (the window list, window
    selector, workspace switcher and show desktop button) are found in
    this directory under gnome-panel, and all run as the process
    "wnck-applet".
